SQL - STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE

SQL stands for 'Structured Query Language'. Is a language used to create queries to control relational databases through an RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems).

The most popular RDBMS that you are going to use is called 'MySQL', and it uses this syntax and has different tools to help design, build, modify and manage a Relational Database based on SQL.

1. Syntax

The following rules apply to all SQL syntax:

> All SQL-reserved keywords must be UPPERCASE
> All SQL instructions finish with semicolon ';'

2. Datatypes

These are the most used datatypes that MySQL supports:

  NULL
    No value

  INT
    Any whole numbers

  DECIMAL(<M>,<N>)
    Decimal numbers
      M: Total number of digits for this number
      N: Number of decimal digits after the decimal place

  VARCHAR(<N>)
    Data of variable characters. A string
      N: Number of characters of the string

  BLOB
    (Binary Large Object). A structure that can store large amounts of data

  DATE
    Date. Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD'

  TIMESTAMP
    Date and time. Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS'

3. Attributes

Attributes are different keywords that a field can be created with to grant them different characteristics and abilities. They are specified when a field is being created, when creating or altering a table:

  PRIMARY KEY
    Specifies the corresponding field to be the primary key of the table. By definition, it is also UNIQUE and NOT NULL.

  AUTO_INCREMENT
    Tells the database to auto increment the specified field (only works with INT datatype).

  UNIQUE
    Does not allow a field to be repeated somewhere else in the table.

  NOT NULL
    Does not allow a field to have a value of NULL.

  DEFAULT <value>
    Sets a default value for the field if the user does not specify a value.
