DATA OPERATIONS - SQL

Here you can find all the operations that you can perform with datasets.

1. Inserting data

Inserts the specified data inside a table:

  # You have to insert data in order
  > INSERT INTO <table_name> VALUES(<field_1>, <field_2>, <...>);

  # Specifies the data to insert 
  > INSERT INTO <table_name>(<fieldname_1>, <fieldname_3>) VALUES(<field_1>, <field_3>)

- Example:

  Insert a new student:
    > INSERT INTO student VALUES (1, 'Jack', 'Biology');

  Insert a new student without major:
    > INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES (2, 'Claire');

2. Reading/retrieving data

  Show the specified dataset from the specified table that mets a certain condition:
    > SELECT <DATASET> FROM <table_name> WHERE <CONDITION> ...;

  (To further expand on this topic, review the 'Querying' folder)

3. Updating data

  Updates the rows in the table that meet certain criteria
    > UPDATE <table_name> SET <field> = <value> WHERE <condition>;

- Example:

  Change the name of 'Biology' major to 'Bio':
    > UPDATE student
    SET major = 'Bio'
    WHERE major = 'Biology';

  Change the major and of student with student_id = 4 to 'Computer Science' and 'Dohn Joe':
    > UPDATE student
    SET major = 'Computer Science', name = 'Dohn Joe'
    WHERE student_id = 4;

  Change the name of all students to 'John Doe':
    > UPDATE student SET name = 'John Doe';

4. Deleting data

  Deletes the rows in the table that meet certain criteria
    > DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>;

- Example:
  Delete the student whose name is 'Tom' and whose major is 'undecided':

    > DELETE FROM student
    WHERE name = 'Tom' AND major = 'undecided';
