BASIC QUERIES

Queries are useful operations created to read the information inside a database in a fast and simple way.

To query data, you use the 'SELECT' keyword. These are the basic queries that you can make in SQL, presented as examples:

* Basic SELECT usage

Select all the fields in the 'student' table:

  > SELECT * FROM student;

Select all the 'name' and 'major' fields in the 'student' table, ordering them by descending alphabetical order of the 'name' field:

  > SELECT student.name, student.major
  FROM student
  ORDER BY name DESC;

Select all the fields in the 'student' table, ordering by 'student_id', and then by 'major', limiting the output at two results:

  > SELECT *
  FROM student
  ORDER BY student_id, major
  LIMIT 2;

Select all the fields in the 'student' table, where the major equals 'Biology' or name equals 'Claire':

  > SELECT *
  FROM student
  WHERE major = 'Biology' OR NAME = 'Claire';
  
Select 'name' and 'major' fields from the 'student' table, where the major is not equal to 'Chemistry', and student_id is more or equal than 3:

  > SELECT student.name, student.major
  WHERE major <> 'Chemistry' AND student_id >= 3;

Select all the fields in the 'student' table where major is 'Chemistry', 'Computer Science' or 'Biology' and student_id is less than 10:

  > SELECT * FROM student
  WHERE major IN ('Chemistry', 'Computer Science', 'Biology') AND student_id < 10;

Select all the distinct majors that there exist in the database:

  > SELECT DISTINCT major FROM student;

Select 'name' and 'major' fields from the 'student' table, nicknaming the fields as 'Student_name' and 'Student_major':

  > SELECT name AS Student_name, major AS Student_major FROM student;
