QUERYING WITH WILDCARDS

You can use the 'LIKE' keyword to make more precise queries.

- Syntax:

  > SELECT <dataset> FROM <table_name> WHERE <field> LIKE '<pattern>'
    Finds the rows that match the specified pattern.
    You can use '%' to specify 'any number of characters', or '_' to specify one character

- Examples:

NOTE: These examples work with the 'Company Database' exercise.

Find any clients who are an LLC:

  > SELECT * FROM client WHERE client_name LIKE '%LLC';

Find any branch suppliers who are in the label business:

  > SELECT * FROM branch_supplier WHERE supplier_name LIKE '%Label%';

Find any employee born in October:

  > SELECT * FROM employee WHERE birth_date LIKE '____-10%'; # Matches four-digit years and days with any number of characters

Find any clients who are schools:

  > SELECT * FROM client WHERE name LIKE '%school%';
