UNITING RESULTS

You can use the 'UNION' keyword to concatenate the results of different 'SELECT' statements in a single one.

The results that you want to combine must have the same number of columns, and a similar datatype.

- Syntax:

  > SELECT <field_name_1>, <field_name_2>, <...>
  FROM <table_name_1>
  UNION
  SELECT <field_name_1>, <field_name_2>, <...>
  FROM <table_name_2>
  ...;

- Examples:

NOTE: These examples work with the 'Company Database' exercise.

Find a list of employee and branch names:

  > SELECT first_name FROM employee
  UNION
  SELECT branch_name FROM branch;

Find a list of all clients and branch suppliers' names:

  > SELECT client_name, client.branch_id
  FROM client
  UNION
  SELECT supplier_name, branch_supplier.branch_id
  FROM branch_supplier;

Find a list of all money spent or earned by the company:

  > SELECT salary FROM employee
  UNION
  SELECT total_sales FROM works_with;
