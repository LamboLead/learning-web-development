DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

When you are trying to create a database, you are going to need to set its architecture: Which information is going to be stored in the database, how is it going to be stored, which tables to create, and how to connect that information together.

A good database architecture allows to create a good infrastructure for the database, which results in an easy to scale and maintain database with a predictable behavior.
