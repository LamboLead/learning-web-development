ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

These are variables that allow you to set the behavior of the NodeJS environment. 

They are stored in the .env file, which is a hidden file used to pass environment variables to the application.

It can be used to store data that you want to keep private or hidden from the user:
> API keys from external services.
> Configuration options.

- Storing environment variables

> Create a new .env file in the root folder of your project.
> Create your desired environment variable using the following format:

  # variable name is uppercase and separated with low dashes
  VAR_NAME_1 = value1
  VAR_NAME_2 = value2

- Accessing environment variables

  These are accessible from the app using the following syntax:
    process.env.VAR_NAME_1

- Example
  Make a JSON response uppercase or not depending on the MESSAGE_STYLE variable.

  > Inside the .env file:
    MESSAGE_STYLE = uppercase

  > Inside the MyApp.js file:
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();

    app.get("/json", (req, res) => {
      if (process.env.MESSAGE_STYLE === "uppercase") {
        res.json("message": "HELLO WORLD");
      } else {
        res.json("message": "Hello world");
      }
    });
