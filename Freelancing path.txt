FREELANCING PLAN

1. Learn the craft

  > Learn a Frontend framework like React.
  > Learn Backend languages and frameworks (JavaScript & Node.js, or Python & Django).
  > Learn databases (SQL, noSQL).
  > Learn to deploy a website (hosting, domains, servers, infrastructure, etc).

1.1. Build a personal portfolio

  Build a web page that stores:
    > Who you are and what can you do for people.
    > Projects that you've worked on.
    > Testimonies of people and companies that have worked with you.
    > A personal blog in which you can post different articles and thoughts.
    > Social media links and ways to contact you.

1.2. Build standard projects

  Figure out what are the types of web applications that the market requires most, and build them. You can build them for fake companies or people (retailerX, gymY, blogZ, etc), or directly build websites for local businesses and offer them, even if they haven't asked for it.

2. Build your reputation and gain experience.

  > Figure out all legal and financial aspects to start working as a freelancer (contracts, workflows, money management, types of clients, etc).

  > Go to local businesses and offer your services: Maybe they dont have a web page, or the page is terrible, or it needs some improvements. You may need to  do it for free for your first clients to start building your reputation and gain experience in the field by creating real projects for real people.

  > You can also go for freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. Start with small projects with little or no payment to get good reviews from people and gain visibility.

  > Also, build an online presence by marketing your services on social media.

3. Set up your charging fees and raise them over time
