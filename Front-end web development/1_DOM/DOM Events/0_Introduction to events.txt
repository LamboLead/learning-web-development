INTRODUCTION TO EVENTS IN JAVASCRIPT

HTML events are things that happen to HTML events. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, it can react on these events, executing code when the event occurs.

1. Syntax

> Embedded JavaScript inside HTML elements

    HTML:
    <element event="someJavascript">

        (e.g. Calling the callDate() function on an onclick event)
            <button onclick="callDate()">The time is?</button>

2. Event objects

When an event occurs in HTML, the event belongs to a certain event object. For example, a mouse click event belongs to the 'MouseEvent' object.

All event objects are based on the 'event' object, and they inherit all of their properties and methods. These are the most common event objects:
