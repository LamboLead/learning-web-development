HTML DOM EVENTS

1. HTML DOM events

The HTML DOM allows to execute code when an event occurs. Events are generated by the browser when things happen to the HTML elements.

- Syntax
    element.addEventListener("event", functionName());
    <element event="JS code"></element>
    element.onclick = function() {JS code}

These are the events that you should keep track of:

# Loading page-related events

    onload
        Triggered when the user enters the page. Useful to check the visitor's browser type and version to load the proper version of the page, or to deal with cookies.
        (e.g. Check for cookies when the page loads)
            <body onload="checkCookies()">

            <input type="text" id="fname" onchange="upperCase()">

# FOCUS events
