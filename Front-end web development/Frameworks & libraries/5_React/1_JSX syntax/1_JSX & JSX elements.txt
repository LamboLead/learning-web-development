JSX

JSX is a syntax extension that allows to write HTML directly within JavaScript.

- Writing JavaScript code into JSX
  To write JavaScript directly into JSX, you include the JS code within curly braces:

    {console.log((This is treated as JavaScript code);)}

- Compiling JSX into JavaScript

  Because the actual language interpreted by the browser is JavaScript, JSX must be compiled into JavaScript.
  The transpiler 'Babel' is a popular tool for this purpose. (INVESTIGATE).

- React's virtual DOM

  React creates a virtual-lightweight representation of the DOM under the hood. To set your JSX code on this virtual DOM you need to call:

    ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'));

1. Creating JSX elements

There are two key types of elements in JSX:

1.1. Simple JSX elements

To create a simple JSX element, use the following syntax:

  let title = <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
  {/* This is a comment in JSX */}

Use the following syntax to define self-closing HTML tags inside JSX:

  const myLineBreak = <br />

1.2. Complex JSX element

A JSX variable must return a single element, which is why all elements inside your complex element have to be wrapped around a parent:

  let complexElement =
    <div>
      <h1>My new title</h1>
      <p>My new paragraph</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First element</li>
        <li>Second element</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
