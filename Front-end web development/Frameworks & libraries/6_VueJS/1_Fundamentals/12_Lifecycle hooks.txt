LIFECYCLE HOOKS

Link: https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html

Lifecycle hooks are functions that can be run by the user on specific stages of the mounting process to the DOM done by Vue.

1. Registering lifecycle hooks

You can register a lifecycle hook inside a component by specifying its name inside the component definition:

  export default {
    mounted() {
      console.log("The component is now mounted");
    }
  }

2. Lifecycle diagram

It is a diagram that helps to understand the mounting process done by Vue when it wants to render a component.

  Start: Renderer encounters a component
    > Setup (Composition API)
    - beforeCreate()
    > Initialize Options API
    - created()
    > Has pre-compiled template?
      Yes: Continue
      No: 'Compile template'
    - beforeMount()
    > Initial render, create & insert to the DOM
    - mounted()
    > Node mounted
      (data changes)
        - beforeUpdate()
        > Re-render and patch
        - updated()
      (component is unmounted)
        - beforeUnmount()
        > Node unmounted
        - unmounted()
