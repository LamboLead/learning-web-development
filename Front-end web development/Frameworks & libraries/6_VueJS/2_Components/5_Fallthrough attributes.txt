FALLTHROUGH ATTRIBUTES

Link: https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs.html

A fallthrough attribute is an attribute or 'v-on' event listener that is passed to a component, but is not explicitly declared in the receiving component's props or emits.

These include 'class', 'style' and 'id' attributes.

1. Attribute inheritance

If a child component is passed an attribute inside its declaration inside a parent component, it will be merged with the child component:

- Example:

  Given a <MyButton> component with the template:
    
    <button class="blue">Click me</button>

  And a parent using this component:
    
    <MyButton class="large" />

  The final rendered DOM will be:

    <button class="blue large">Click me</button>

The same passes with 'v-on':

  <MyButton @click="onClick" />

The 'click' listener will be added to the root element of <MyButton> (the native <button> element). If the native <button> already has a 'click' listener, then both listeners will trigger.

NOTE: If a component renders another component inside of it, the fallthrough attributes received by him will be forwarded to all of its children.

2. Disabling attribute inheritance

If you dont want a component to automatically inherit attributes, you can set 'inheritAttrs: false' in the component's options.

The fallthrough attributes can be accessed directly in template expressions as '$attrs':

  <span>fallthrough attributes: {{$attrs}}</span>

The '$attrs' object includes all attributes that are not declared by the component's props or emits ('class', 'style', 'v-on', etc).

Notes:
> fallthrough attributes preserve their original casing. An attribute like 'foo-bar' needs to be accessed as '$attrs.["foo-bar"]'.
> A 'v-on' event listener like '@click' will be exposed on the object as a function under '$attrs.onClick'.

- Example

  You may want to wrap the actual <button> element with an extra <div> for styling purposes.
  
  You want all fallthrough attributes like 'class' and 'v-on' listeners to be applied to the inner <button>. You can achieve this with 'inheritAttrs: false' and 'v-bind="$attrs"':

    <div class="btn-wrapper">
      <button class="btn" v-bind="$attrs">Click me</button>
    </div>

  'v-bind' without an argument binds all the properties of an object as attributes of the target element.

3. Attribute inheritance on multiple root nodes

Components with multiple root nodes dont have an automatic attribute fallthrough behavior. If '$attrs' are not bound explicitly, a runtime warning will be issued.

- Example

  <CustomLayout id="custom-layout" @click="changeValue" />

  You need to add '$attrs' to the multi-root template to supress the warning:

    <header>...</header>
    <main v-bind="$attrs">...</main>
    <footer>...</footer>

4. Accessing fallthrough attributes in JavaScript

You can access a component's fallthrough attributes using the '$attrs' instance property:

  export default {
    created() {
      console.log(this.$attrs)
    }
  }
