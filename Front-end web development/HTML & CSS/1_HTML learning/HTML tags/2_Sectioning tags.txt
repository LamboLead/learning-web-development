SECTIONING HTML TAGS

<article/>
    Groups independent, self-contained content (e.g. a blog entry).

<section/>
    Groups related content, generally inside an <article>.

<div/>
    Groups content, not necessarily correlated with one another.

"If a book is the <article>, each chapter is a <section>. When there's no relationship between groups of content, use a <div>".
