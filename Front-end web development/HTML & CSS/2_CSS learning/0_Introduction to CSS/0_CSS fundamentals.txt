CSS FUNDAMENTALS

CSS (Cascade-StyleSheets) is a language that allows the customization of web pages.

1. CSS Box Model

Each element in an HTML document has a predefined way of arranging itself. Here are the two main arrangements and the elements that perform them by default:

    > Block-level items: The elements automatically start on a new line
        - <header>
        - <p>
        - <article>, <section>, <div>

    > Inline items: The elements sit within the surrounding content in the same line
        - <figure>, <img>
        - <span>

2. Measurement units

To specify the position or size of elements in an HTML document, CSS works with the following categories of measurement units:

    > Absolute: These tie to physical units of length.
        - in (inches)
        - mm (millimeters)
        - px (pixels)

    > Relative: These units are defined relative to another length, generally the one of the parent.
        - %
        - em
        - rem
