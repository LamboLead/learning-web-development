CSS FUNCTIONS

CSS functions are used to set values from many CSS properties. There are functions that can be used for image manipulation, transform shapes, etc.

attr(<attribute-name> <type-or-unit>, <fallback>)
    Returns the value of the attribute of an HTML element. It can on ly be used in the content property, though.
    - <attribute-name>
        Name of the attribute of the HTML element referenced in the CSS.
    - <type-or-unit>
        Keyword representing the type (<string>, <color>, <url>, <integer>, <number>, <angle>, <time>, <deg>) or unit (em, ex, px, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax, mm, cm, in, pt, or pc) of the referenced attribute.

1. Mathematical functions

calc(<mathematical-operation>)
    Used to calculate the value of length, angle, time, or number-related properties. It allows to set values based on addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) of different units of measurement.

sin()
cos()
tan()
acos()
asin()
atan()
sqrt()
hypot()
pow()

2. Responsive web design functions

These functions only work when applied to sizing properties (width, height, font-size, etc.)

clamp(<minimum-length>, <preferred-length>, <maximum-length>)
    Sets the length of the property to the preferred length, keeping it in the range between minimum and maximum specified lengths.

min(<value1>, <value2>, ...)
    Compares each value and sets the length of the property to the minimum of them.

max(<value1>, <value2>, ...) 
    Compares each value and sets the length of the property to the maximum of them.

3. Color functions

rgba(<red>, <green>, <blue>)
    Specifies a color value, ranging from 0 to 255 for each color.

rgba(<red>, <green>, <blue>, <alpha-transparency>)
    Specifies a color value, ranging from 0 to 255 for each color, including alpha-transparency.

hsl(<hue>, <saturation>, <lightness>)
    Sets a color value in CSS.

hsla(<hue>, <saturation>, <lightness>, <alfa-transparency>)
    Sets color value in CSS.

linear-gradient(<direction>, <color-list>)
    Creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line.
    - <direction>
        Specifies the direction of the line that the gradient will be created.
    - <color-list>
        Specifies the colors that the gradient will have

repeating-linear-gradient(<direction>, <color-list> <length>, ...)
    Creates an infinitely repeating linear gradient.
    
radial-gradient(<shape>, <extent-keyword>, <position>, colors...)
    Creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a radial direction.

repeating-radial-gradient(<direction>, <color-list> <length>, ...)
        Creates an infinitely repeating radial gradient.

4. Image manipulation functions

These functions only work when applied to the 'filter' property

blur(<length>)
    Defines the value of pixels on the screen that will blend into each other. Applied to images, background images, or text.
    - 0px
        The images remain unchanged.

brightness(<percentage>)
    Applies a brightness multiplier to the image, making it appear more or less bright.
    - 0%
        The image turns completely black.
    - 100%
        The image remains unchanged.
        
contrast(<percentage>)
    Manipulates the contrast of images or background images.
    - < 100%
        Decreases the contrast.
    - > 100%
        Increases the contrast.

drop-shadow(<offsett-x> <offset-y> <blur> <color>)
    Adds a shadow to images, including their transparent areas.

grayscale(<percentage>)
    Turns an image into a grayscale image.
    - 0%
        The image remains unchanged.
    - 100%
        The image turns to grayscale completely.

sepia(<percentage>)
    Turns the image into sepia (black and white with a brown tint).

hue-rotate(<angle>)
    Changes the color of the image by rotating the hue on the color wheel.

invert(<percentage>)
    Inverts the colors of the image, turning it into its negative.

saturate(<percentage>)
    Changes the color saturation in an image.
    - < 100%
        Lowers saturation.
    - > 100%
        Increases saturation.

opacity(<percentage>)
    Sets the degree of transparency of an image, similarly to the 'opacity' property.


5. Transformation functions

These functions only work when applied to the 'transform' property.

translate(<translate-x>, <translate-y>)
    Moves the element relative to the original location by a given value.

translate3d(<translate-x>, <translate-y>, <translate-z>)
    Moves the element relative to the original location in a three-dimensional space.

scale(<scale-x>, <scale-y>)
    Scales an element in two-dimensional space horizontally and vertically or simultaneously in both directions.

scale3d(<scale-x>, <scale-y>, <scale-z>)
    Scales an element in a three-dimensional space.

rotate(<angle>)
    Rotates an element in two-dimensional space around a rotation point by a given angle. The default rotation point is located in the center of the element and can be changed using the 'transform-origin' property.

rotateX(<angle>) | rotateY(<angle>) | rotateZ(<angle>)
    Rotates an element around the X|Y|Z axis by a given angle.

rotate3d(<number-x>, <number-y>, <number-z>, <angle>)
    Rotates elements in a three-dimensional space.

skew(<angle-x>, <angle-y>)
    Tilts the element in two-dimensional space horizontally and vertically or simultaneously in both directions.

perspective(<length>)
    Determines the distance from the screen plane to the point of convergence of the lines. It moves the element through the z-axis by a specified length.

6. Shape functions

These functions only work when applied to the 'clip-path' property.

circle([<circle-radius> <position>])

ellipse([<ellipse-radius> <position>])

inset(<offset> [<border-radius>])

polygon(...)
