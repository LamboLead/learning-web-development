If/else if/else blocks

The following function uses an if/else statement to check a condition:

    function findGreater(a, b) {
        if(a > b) {
            return "a is greater";
        } else {
            return "b is greater";
        }
    }

The conditional operator

The syntax is a ? b : c, where a is the condition, b is the code to run when the condition returns true, and c is the code to run when the condition returns false.

This can be re-written using the conditional operator:

    function findGreater(a, b) {
        return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
    }

You can also emulate if/ else if/ else conditionals, just like the following snippet:

    function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
        return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
        : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
        : "b is greater";
    }
