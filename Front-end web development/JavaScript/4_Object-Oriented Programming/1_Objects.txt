JavaScript objects:

An object is an absctract representation written in code of an object in the real world.

Here's a sample cat object:

var cat = {
    "name": "Whiskers",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as: name, legs, and tails. However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:

var anotherObject = {
    make: "Ford",
    5: "five",
    "model": "focus"
};
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

1. Accessing an object's properties.

- Dot notation

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

    var myObj = {
        prop1: "val1",
        prop2: "val2"
    };
    var prop1val = myObj.prop1;
    var prop2val = myObj.prop2;
prop1val would have a value of the string val1, and prop2val would have a value of the string val2.

- Bracket notation

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

    var myObj = {
        "Space Name": "Kirk",
        "More Space": "Spock",
        "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
    };
    myObj["Space Name"];
    myObj['More Space'];
    myObj["NoSpace"];
myObj["Space Name"] would be the string Kirk, myObj['More Space'] would be the string Spock, and myObj["NoSpace"] would be the string USS Enterprise.

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

    var dogs = {
        Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
    };
    var myDog = "Hunter";
    var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
    console.log(myBreed);
    
The string Doberman would be displayed in the console.

2. Changing an object's properties

You can change your object's properties using both notations:

    myDog.name = "Happy Camper";

You can also add new properties to your objects:

    myDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

3. Delete properties from objects:

    delete myDog.bark;
