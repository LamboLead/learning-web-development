FILE INTERFACE

It provides information about files and allows JavaScript to access their content.

Ways to retrieve a file object:
> From a FileList object returned as a result of a user selecting files using the 'input' element.
> From a drag and drop operation's DataTransfer object.
> From the 'mozGetAsFile()' API on an HTML 'canvas' element.

A File object is a specific kind of Blob and can be used in any context that a Blob can; for example: FileReader, URL.createobjectURL(), createImageBitMap(), XMLHttpRequest.send().
