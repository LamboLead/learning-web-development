CANVAS API

It provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and HTML canvas element. It can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.

It largely focuses on 2D graphics. The WebGL API draws hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics.
