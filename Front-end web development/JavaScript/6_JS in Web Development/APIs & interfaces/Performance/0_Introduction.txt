MEASURING PERFORMANCE IN WEBSITES

You need to measure performance in your websites because a great part of a good user experience depends into it (the time the website takes to do something when the user gives an order).

- What to measure?

Measure the performance on your website based on the RAIL model:

> Response: Time between the user clicks on a button and the site reacts to it (ideally less than 100ms).
> Animation: Smoothness of the animation being displayed (ideally more than 50fps, or 17ms between frames).
> Idle: 
> Load: Time that the page takes to load its resources [Investigate about first contentful paint (about 1s), time to interaction, etc].

- When to measure?

There are three ways in which you can measure it:

> Locally (during development), by using Edge DevTools.
> Pre-release (before sending page to production), with Lighthouse CI, for example.
> In production (with real user-experiences), by using Web Performance APIs.

- Examples of what you can track

> DNS performance: Response time of your DNS provider.
> Page load: Loading time in between the user clicks your link, and the page loads completely.
