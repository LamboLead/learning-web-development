ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT

0. Introduction
Tipically, JavaScript is single-threated (sinchronous). It means that each line of code executes one after another, and the execution of the following line doesn't happen until the last one has been executed.

However, when dealing with operations that demand loading times, JavaScript allows to execute asynchronous code. Those Web APIs that fetch resources from an external source (a file from a network or a database) and return data from it work with asynchronous code.

1. Asynchronous code

There are different ways of writing asynchronous code in JavaScript:

- Async callbacks
- Promises
- Timeouts and intervals
- Async/await syntax

2. The event queue

Asynchronous operations are put into an event queue, which runs after the main thread has finished processing, so that thet don't block subsequent JavaScript code from running...
