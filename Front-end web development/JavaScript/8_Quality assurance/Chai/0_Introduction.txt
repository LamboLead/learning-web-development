CHAI

Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you confirm that your program behaves the way you expect.

Chai allows to write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if it meets them.

0. Setting up Chai

- Installation
  You need to install Chai, Chai HTTP, Mocha, and Zombie testing libraries by adding them to the 'package.json' file.

- Folder set up
  Create a /tests folder in which all the 'test1.js' will be stored.

* General

- Behavioural Driven Development

- Unit testing:
  Writing tests that check if a function or piece of code works.
  > Only calls the specific function or executes the piece of code to run the test.
  > These are run all over the development phase to ensure that everything works as you introduce more changes into the application.

- Integration testing:
  Writing tests to check if the different pieces of code work together properly.
