INTRODUCTION TO GSAP

It is an animation library for JavaScript. It animates anything that JavaScript can touch with amazing performance.

> It is a property manipulator. It changes different element properties many times per second. From CSS properties, SVG attributes, objects rendered to a canvas, camera position in a 3D scene (for libraries like Three.js or Pixi.js), etc.
> Works with React, Vue, and Angular front end frameworks.

- Composition

  It is composed of its core (GSAP core), and different plugins, easing tools, utility methods, and more:

  Interesting plugins:
    > DrawSVG: Creates 'drawing' animations easily by manipulating the stroke properties of an SVG.
    > MorphSVG: Morphs SVG paths by animating the data inside the 'd' attribute inside an SVG.
    > SplitText: Makes it easy to break apart text in an HTML element so that each character-word-line has its own <div>, making animations simple.
    > Draggable: Makes any DOM element draggable, spinnable, tossable, etc, using mouse and/or touch events. You can pair it with InertiaPlugin to decelerate the motion based on momentum.
    > MotionPath: Animates any object along a path or arbitrary property values.
