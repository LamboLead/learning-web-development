GSAP TIMELINES

A timeline is a container of tweens, placing them one after the other. 
> Tweens can overlap or have gaps between them.
> As the timeline playhead moves, it renders its tween children accordingly.
> Timelines can be nested within timelines to make modular code for animations (separating each animation in small timelines and make them part of a bigger timeline).

1. When to use a timeline?
> To control a group of animations.
> To build a sequence without adding lots of delay values to make automatic timing adjustments.
> To modularize the animation code.
> To fire a callback function based on the execution of a group of animations.

2. Creating timelines

- Syntax:
  let timeline = gsap.timeline(<options>)
  timeline.<method>(...)

    <options>
      Object with different options for the timeline.

- Methods:
  .add(<tween>, <position>)
    Adds the specified tween to the timeline
    <position>: Specifies the timestamp start of the execution of the tween
      "+=X" (gap): X seconds after the end of the timeline.
      "-=X" (overlap): X seconds before end of timeline.
      "X" (absolute): At X seconds from the beginning of timeline.

  .to(<target(s)>, <properties>, <position>)
  .from(<target(s)>, <properties>, <position>)
  .fromTo(<target(s)>, <propertiesFrom>, <propertiesTo>)
    Same as '.add(gsap.to(...))' / '.from(gsap.to(...))' / '.fromTo(gsap.to(...))'

* Timeline special properties
  
- Syntax:
  let timeline = gsap.timeline({<property> : <value>, ...})

- Property-value:

  defaults: <propertyObject>
    Makes all children tweens and timelines to inherit values.
    e.g:
      let tl = gsap.timeline({defaults: {duration: 1}});

  repeat: <number>
    Repeats the timeline according to the specified value.

  repeatDelay: <seconds>
    Specifies the delay before each repetition of the timeline.

  yoyo: <boolean>
    If 'true', playback will alternate forwards and backwards on each repeat.

  delay: <seconds>
    Delay before the timeline should start.

  onComplete, onRepeat, onUpdate: <callback>
    Function to call according to the callback name.

* Notes about timelines
  > You can chain different methods for a single timeline.
  > By default, animations are inserted one after the other, but you can modify the order of the animations in a timeline with the 'position' parameter.
  > You can control timelines by using almost the same getter and setter methods from tweens.
