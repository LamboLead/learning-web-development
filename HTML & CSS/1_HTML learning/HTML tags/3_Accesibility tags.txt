ACCESIBILITY HTML TAGS

<header/>
    Wraps introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag. Works well around content repeated across multiple pages.

<main/>
    Wraps the main content of the page. There has to be only one per page.

<footer/>
    Wraps around information or links sitting at the bottom of the page.

<nav/>
    Wraps around the main navigation links in the page.

<time/>
    Wraps a date or time
    - datetime = "date"
    Specifies a certain date on a standardized format.

EXAMPLE

<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main></main>
<p> Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between goro and Scorpion <time datetime="2013-02-13">last Wednesday</time>, which ended in a draw.</p>
<footer></footer>

TIPS

> Use alt attribute for your images to improve accesibility for the users with visual impediments.
> Pick your headers (h1...h6) so that they have semantic meaning and relate to each other.
> h1 should only appear once in your HTML code.
> Anchor tags should wrap text that is meaningful and relates to the link that is referencing to (avoid "Click here" and related)
> Use the attribute accesskey to add interactivity to keyboard-only users on interactive elements (links, buttons, and form controls)
