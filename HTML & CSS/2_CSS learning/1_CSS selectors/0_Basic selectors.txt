CSS BASIC SELECTORS

To specify which properties are applied to which elements in the HTML document, CSS works with the following selectors, in the following preference order:

    1. In-line styles: Styles specified on the same line that the element is defined:
        HTML:
            <p style="color: blue;"></p>

    2. By id: Styles applied to elements with a certain id:
        HTML:
            <p id="this_paragraph">
        CSS:
            #this_paragraph {
                color: blue;
            }

    3. By class: Styles applied to elements with a certain class:
        HTML:
            <p class="paragraph style"></p>
        CSS:
            .paragraph_style {
                color: blue;
            }

    4. By attribute / By tag: Styles applied to one kind of element or elements that have a certain attribute:
        HTML:
            <a href="www.natalie_portman_goddess.com">
            <p></p>
            <div></div>
        CSS:
            [href="www.natalie_portman_goddess.com"] {
                color: red;
            }
            p, div {
                color: blue;
            }

    5. Universal selector: The style is applied to every HTML element:
        CSS:
            * {
                color: blue;
            }

Note: Typing '!important' after a selector overrides every other style applied by another selector.
