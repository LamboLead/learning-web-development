CSS COMBINATOR SELECTORS

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between two or more selectors. These are the combinators in CSS:

> Descendant selector ( )
    Matches all elements that are descentants of a specified element.

    - e.g. Select all <p> elements inside <div> elements:
        div p {
            background-color: yellow;
        }

> Child selector (>)
    Selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

    - e.g. Select all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:
        div > p {
            background-color: yellow;
        }

> Adjacent sibling selector (+)
    Selects an element that is directly after another specific element.

    - e.g. Select the first <p> elements that are placed immediately after <div> elements:
        div + p {
            background-color: yellow;
        }

> General sibling selector (~)
    Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.

    - e.g. Select all <p> element that are siblings of <div> elements:
        div ~ p {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
