CSS TRANSITIONS

CSS transitions allow you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

1. CSS transition properties

* transition
    Combines 'transition-property', 'transition-duration', 'transition-timing-function', and 'transition-delay' in one property.

* transition-property
    Specifies the property you want to apply the transition to.
    - [property]

* transition-duration
    Specifies the transition's duration.
    - [positive integer]

* transition-timing-function
    Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
    - ease
        Start slow -> Speed up -> End slow
    - ease-out
        Start quickly -> End slow
    - ease-in
        Start slow -> End quickly
    - ease-in-out
        Start slow -> End slow
    - linear
        Constant speed
    - cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        x, y represents position vs time. (x1, y1) represents the first point, and (x2, y2) represents the second point of the bezier curve.
        (e.g. cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75) => linear)
        (e.g. cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1) => ease-out)
        (e.g. cubic-bezier(0.311, 0.441, 0.444, 1.649) => "Bouncing" movement)

* transition-delay
    Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.
    - [positive integer]

2. Additional content

You can specify several properties at once:

div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 200px;
    transition: width 2s, height 4s;
}

NOTE: If the duration is not specified, the transition will have no effect.
