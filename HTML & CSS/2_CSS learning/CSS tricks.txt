CSS TRICKS

1. Pay attention to the CSS box model

    In the dev tools of your browser, you can see the box model for each element on your web page. Use it as a reference to know exactly how the elements fit on the window.

2. Use CSS flexbox for simple layouts

    Flexbox allows to create simple layouts inside containers with ease. Use it as much as possible to create them instead of the old positioning properties for each children.

3. Use CSS grid for complex layouts

    Think of grid as a table layout for children elements. Use grid to create layouts that involve multiple rows and columns, and make them responsive using relative length units.

4. Use CSS variables

    Use CSS variables when creating color palettes, or directly using the same properties for different elements. This allows you to change their values faster if needed.

4. Use min, max, and clamp() to create responsive web pages
