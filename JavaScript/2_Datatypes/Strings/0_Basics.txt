STRINGS BASICS

Strings are text enclosed by single or double-quotes.

"This is a string"
'This is also a string'

Escape characters

Because some characters belong to JS syntax, you must put escape characters to use them inside of strings.

    \"  Double-quote                            "
    \'  Single-quote                            '
    \\  Backslash
    \n  Newline
    \r  Carriage return
    \t  Tab
    \b  Word boundary
    \f  Form feed

Indexing

You can refer to certain characters of a string by indexing them

    var myString = "Hello World!";
    var char1 = myString[4] # refers to 'o'
    var char2 = myString[-1] # refers to '!'
