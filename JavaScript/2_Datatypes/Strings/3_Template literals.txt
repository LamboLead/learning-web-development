TEMPLATE LITERALS

Is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier. They allow to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

Consider the code below:

    const person = {
        name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
        age: 56
    };

    const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
    I am ${person.age} years old.`;

    console.log(greeting);

The console will display the strings 'Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!' and 'I am 56 years old.'.

A lot of things happened there: 
The example uses backticks (`), not quotes (' or "), to wrap the string.
Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the output. This saves inserting '\n' within strings.
The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you wont have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with '${' and '}'.
Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, for example ${a + b}. This new way of creating strings gives you more flexibility to create robust strings.
