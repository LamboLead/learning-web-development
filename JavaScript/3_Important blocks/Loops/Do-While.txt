Do... While loop

It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.
The code inside the loop will run at least once.

    var ourArray = [];
    var i = 0;
    do {
        ourArray.push(i);
        i++;
    } while (i < 5);

The example above behaves similar to other types of loops, and the resulting array will look like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. 

    var ourArray = []; 
    var i = 5;
    do {
        ourArray.push(i);
        i++;
    } while (i < 5);

In this case, we initialize the value of i to 5. When we get to the next line, there is no condition to evaluate, so we go to the code inside the curly braces and execute it. We will add a single element to the array and then increment i before we get to the condition check. When we finally evaluate the condition i < 5 on the last line, we see that i is now 6, which fails the conditional check, so we exit the loop and are done. At the end of the above example, the value of ourArray is [5].
