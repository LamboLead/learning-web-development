For loop

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the intialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When the condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if the condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now have the value [0,1,2,3,4].

---
For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers, backwards, etc.

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
    ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [0,2,4,6,8]

Nesting For Loops

If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:

var arr = [
    [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
];
for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (var j=0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
        console.log(arr[i][j]);
    }
}
This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note that for the inner loop, we are checking the .length of arr[i], since arr[i] is itself an array.
