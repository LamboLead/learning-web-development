1. Using the console

    console.log();


2. Check the type of a variable

    typeof <thing>;

    JavaScript recognizes six immutable data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol; and one type for mutable items Object (arrays are objects as well).

3. Error types

Syntax errors: Refer to wrong syntax writing.

    ReferenceError
        Occurrs when the name of a function or a variable doesn't exist.

    SyntaxError
        Occurrs when JS expected a character but finds another one (e.g. not closing a parentheses or curly bracket).
    
Runtime errors: Refer to errors that occur during the execution of the code, even while the syntax is correct.

    e.g.
    When a function's arguments are supplied in the incorrect order.

    Off By One Errors: When iterating through an array, if the index is incorrectly specified, the program may throw a reference "index out of range".

    Infinite loops: When the terminal conditions for a loop are not set correctly, and the loop runs undefinitely.
