1. Typed arrays

Is an array-like datatype which contents are strictly controlled by their size in bits.

There are different kinds of typed arrays:

Integer typed arrays (IntNArray): Every element in the array is an integer and occupies N bits.

> Int8Array: From -128 to 127.
> UInt8Array: From 0 to 255.
> UInt8ClampedArray: From 0 to 255. If it finds a negative number, it converts it to 0.

> Int16Array: From -32768 to 32767
> UInt16Array: From 0 to 65535.
> UInt16ClampedArray: ...

> Int32Array: From -2147483648 to 2147483647.
> UInt32Array: From 0 to 4294967295.
> UInt32ClampedArray: ...

Float typed arrays (FloatNArray): Every element in the array can be an integer or a float and occupies N bits.
> Float32Array: From 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38.
> Float64Array: From 5.0E-324 to 1.8E308.

2. ArrayBuffer object

It is the container for all typed arrays. It represents the chunk of memory that is set aside to hold the typed arrays.

Although the ArrayBuffer holds the binary data, it cannot modify it without a DataView.

3. DataView object

It is the object that takes an ArrayBuffer and allows the interaction and modification of its elements.
