WEB STORAGE

0. Introduction

It is a mechanism to store data locally on the user's browser. It is composed of "Session Storage" and "Local Storage". There are some aspects to consider while working with Web Storage:

> It is not secure to store sensitive data and can be accessed by any website using any code.
> It scan store more data than cookies (up to 5MB).
> It stores information only on the browser. Therefore it is not a substitute for a server-based database.
> It is asynchronous: Although each operation executes one after another, loading times depend on the user's hardware.
> It stores data in a key-value pair configuration. Both keys and values can only be strings.

1. Methods

.setItem(<key>, <value>)
    Adds a key-value pair to Local Storage.

.getItem(<key>)
    Fetchs or retrieves the value from Local Storage using its key.

. removeItem(<key>)
    Removes an item from Local Storage using its key.

.clear()
    Deletes all information saved in Local Storage.

2. Session Storage

Session Storage is a way of storing information locally that is deleted when the user closes the browser's window or tab.

- Syntax:
    sessionStorage.method(...);

3. Local Storage

LocalStorage is a way of storing information locally that doesn't have any expiration date. This means that the data will always persist, even after the browser window is closed.

- Syntax:
    localStorage.method(...);
