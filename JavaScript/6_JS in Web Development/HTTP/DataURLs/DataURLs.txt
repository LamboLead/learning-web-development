DATA URLS

These are URLs prefixed with the 'data:' scheme. They allow content creators to embed small files in web documents.

- Syntax:

  data:[<mediatype>][;base64],<data>

    <mediatype> : MIME type string to identify the format and type of the file.

1. Base64 encoding

Is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in ASCII string format by translating into a radix-64 representation.

> Because they only consist of ASCII characters, base64 strings are generally url-save, which is why they can be used to encode data in Data URLs.
> Some browsers have a limit for the length of URLs: its maximum for Opera 11 is 65535 characters long, and for Edge is 4GB.
> Do not use them as an encoding scheme to secure critical data: Decoding base64 strings can be done by any programming language.
