FILE MANAGEMENT IN WEB DEVELOPMENT

This section describes how to organize the files for a web project locally and in the server.

* Where should the website live inside the computer?

When working on a website locally, you should keep all related files in a single folder that mirrors teh published website's file structure on the server. This folder should have a meaningful name.

* Casing and spacing

You should name folders and files completely in lowercase with no spaces because:
> Many computers (specially servers), are case-sensitive.
> Browsers, web servers, and programming languages do not handle spaces consistently. Instead of spaces or underscores, separate words using hyphens "-".

* Folder structure

You should use the following folder structure for the website that you're building, depending on the technology that you are going to be using:

- Vanilla JavaScript

  > ...
  > node_modules (contains all node modules files)
  > public (contains images, SVGs, videos, fonts, and other assets)
    > img
    > svg
    > fonts
    ...
  > src (contains all website-related files and folders)
    > js (contains all JavaScript files)
    > styles (contains all SASS/SCSS/CSS files)
    index.html (contains the homepage content)
  package.json
  package-lock.json
  README.md
  ...

- React
  > ...
  > build (contains the website code ready for production)
  > node_modules
  > public (contains all images, fonts, and other assets)
    index.html
    > fonts
    > images
    ...
  > src (contains all website-related files)
    > styles (contains all SASS/SCSS/CSS files)
    > components (contains all React files separated by components)
  package.json
  package-lock.json
