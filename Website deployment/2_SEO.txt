SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

SEO is the term that refers to the rank that search engines (Google, Bing, etc) give your website so that is prioritized over others in searches.

Tips to improve the SEO of your pages:

> Use web hosting companies that provide tools to improve your SEO.
> Low Latency: Pages that load in more than 1s are ranked lower.
> Ease of navigation: The website has to be easy for search engines and users to navigate (good HTML structure, provided accesibility, responsiveness & good mobile website).
> Use <h1> tags: These are the first tags that search engines scan to put as the header on searches.
> Use compact images and media to improve loading speeds.
> Get rid of pop-ups alerts.
> Avoid infinite scrolling because it cannot be used by search engines to scrape other links inside your webpage.
